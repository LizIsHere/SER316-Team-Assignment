Anglela Mehlhase decided to go take her Hund Spot for a drive in her new BMW to the Eltz family schloss.
After arriving at the schloss, she happily discovered that her family had prepared tables and tables covered with gebaeck, including her favorite desert, the apfelkuchen.
Before Mehlhase could even get out of the car, Spot jumpped out of the window and dove for the apfelkenchen her family had brought from the baeckerei.
After mere minutes, the only food left untouched were the brot and bratwurst, all thanks to the scary family cat perched upon the table nearby that even Spot wants to avoid.
During the chaos, Mehlhase tried to stop Spot by pulling on his leash but instead ended up being dragged by Spot which led to her dirndel being covered in the grease of the doener.
After getting completely messy from the debacle, Angela needed to change clothes because she was going to the biergarten in Berlin later that night for a date.
